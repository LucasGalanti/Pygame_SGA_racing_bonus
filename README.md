# SGA Racing Bonus Game

## Introduction

This project was developed as a part of an initiative by the Sales Intelligence team at Saint-Gobain Abrasives. The primary objective was to devise an interactive and engaging method to explain a new bonus methodology to our sales team. The result is an interactive game built using Pygame, which simulates a month of sales, providing real-time feedback on goal achievement and bonus accumulation.

## Game Description

The game is structured like a card game, where the player, representing a sales representative, is required to make sales on specific days of the month (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and 30th). On each of these days, the player is presented with four cards, each representing a potential sale with a specific product and monetary value. The player must choose two cards per day, simulating the sales made. The final results are dependent on the choices made by the player.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Card Generator (`card_generator.ipynb`):** This Jupyter notebook takes as input the number of product lines, the goal and weight of each product line in the old bonus model, among other values. It generates random card sets for each sales day and simulates 1000 games with these card sets to calculate the potential bonus under each model. Based on developer-defined approval criteria (average winnings, comparative gain of the new model over the old, etc.), the notebook approves or disapproves the card sets. The approved card sets are then outputted to a .json file for use in the second part of the project.

2. **Card Game (`Card_Game.py`):** This Pygame script takes the .json file generated by the card generator as input and runs the game.

## Confidentiality

Please note that the version of this project shared on GitHub has been modified to maintain the confidentiality of Saint-Gobain's strategy. All sensitive information, including numbers, targets, and product names, has been changed.

## Conclusion

This project was a successful endeavor in improving the understanding of our new bonus methodology among the sales team. We hope that it can serve as a useful reference for similar initiatives in other organizations.
